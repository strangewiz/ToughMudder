Running Man

To get yourself in peak cardio condition, you can either: 
1)  Get on a treadmill.  Start jogging at a slow comfortable pace for the first 5 minutes, then increase the speed to a full 
sprint for a full minute before reducing the speed back down to a jog for a minute or two.  Alternate between jogging 
and sprinting for 35 minutes.  Build up to 1 hr.
2) Free run.  As you head outside for a jog, choose a point or landmark in the distance that’s reasonably far and sprint to 
it.  Do this 10 or so times throughout the course of your run, paying attention to mixing in jogging and sprinting equally.  
Again, build up to running 3-4 times a week and increasing your distance gradually until you can comfortably run 5+ 
miles.

Start out in a regular pushup position with two dumb bells in each hand.  As you push your body upwards, rotate your 
torso at peak height and bring your right hand up behind you so that your hands are in a vertical line. Lower the weight 
so that you are once again in push up position.  Do a push up, repeating with your left hand.

Grab a dumbbell, kettle bell, or anything heavy with a handle, in one hand and let it hang in front of you.  Lower the 
weight below your hips and let it swing between your knees and legs.  Try to keep your core sturdy and straight, explode upwards and swing the weight up to about eye level in a fully upright position.  With control, do this as many times as 
you can, spending about 45 seconds on each arm.

Scissor Kick

From a regular standing position, take one big step forward and lower yourself into a forward stepping lunge. This is the 
start position.  From there, explode off the ground, getting enough air under you to scissor kick your legs and land with 
your opposite leg forward and ready to crouch down to the lunge position.  Keep doing this, alternating your legs on 
each jump/repetition for 60 seconds.

Tough Chin Up 
#
Just like your old man used to do, hang from a bar with either an overhand or underhand grip and pull yourself up – be 
sure to try and touch your chest to the bar, or get as close as you can.  This will get progressively harder as the set wears
on.  Remember to do as many as you can for the full 60 seconds.  Even if you have to take a slight break, be sure to finish 
the set.
